*** Type safe deepl learning framework for OCaml written from scratch

**** Currently supporting
- Fully connected
- Convolutional 3D
- Pooling 3D
- Flatten 3D
layers

**** The main idea behind
is to check the Neural Network architecture at compile time,
making code like:
#+begin_src ocaml
   make_input3 [| 28; 28; 1|]
   |> make_conv3d (* some params*)
   |> make_fully_connected (* fully connected layer after the convolutional 3D one does not make any sense *)
#+end_src

absolutely impossible.
This is something that makes the hole codebase much safer and something
that is not done by Owl deep learning library.

Initially I was using Lapack linear algebra bindings for OCaml
but it makes the operations like matrix reshape or flatten
extremely complicated and expensive so the matrix library for this framework
is also written from scratch.

This repo is an experimental project and a work in progress so sometimes it doesn't even compile
